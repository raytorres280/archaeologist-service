# You must have Free Bond available on the Sarcophagus Contract to accept new jobs.

# This number will be reset to 0 after the service is started, so it must be manually set before running the service each time you want to deposit to free bond.

# When the service starts, the number here will be subtracted from your "Free Bond" on the Sarcophagus Contract
# This number will be reset to 0 after the service is started, so it must be manually set before running the service each time you want to withdraw from free bond.
